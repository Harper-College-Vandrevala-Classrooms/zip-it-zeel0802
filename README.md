## Instructions

You can find the instructions for this lab [here](https://cyrusvandrevala.com/teaching/csc/214/labs/zip-it.html).

In this lab, you will update both the source file and test file. Your implementation will live in `src/main/java/com/csc/Zipper.java` and your tests might live in `src/test/java/com/csc/TestZipper.java`. Feel free to create additional source and test files as needed.

## Gradle

1. Visit the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) installation homepage.
2. Find your operatoring system, and follow the instructions to install Gradle.

## Testing
